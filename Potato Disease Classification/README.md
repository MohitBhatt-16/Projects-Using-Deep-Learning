# Potato Disease Classification

This project focuses on detecting disease on potato plants from images of the leaves of plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on an imaged dataset containig different images of leaves, and data augmentation techniques have been applied to imporve the model generalization.
The most common disease are Late Blight and Early Blight so in this we will work on a dataset that contains images of leaves which are uninfected or infected with Late Blight or Early Blight
This project can be very helpful for potato farmers because it can help them in knowing the disease during early stages and thus they can take preventive measures thus saving the crop

## Requirements

- Google Colaboratory account/Jupyter Notebook
- Understanding of Python, TensorFlow, and Keras

## Installation

1. Download the .ipynb file.

2. Upload the file to your drive and open it as a google colab file or use jupyter notebook

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project has been attached with the file. You can download the dataset from here and manually upload it to the directory where the file is.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is implemented within the notebook. Refer to the "Data Augmentation" section in the notebook for details on how augmentation is applied during the training process.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture is defined within the Colab notebook. Look for the code cells related to model architecture to understand the layers and structure.

## Training

Follow the training steps outlined in the Colab notebook. Execute the cells related to model training to initiate the training process.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model on a test set using the evaluation cells provided in the Colab notebook.
